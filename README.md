# Console Blackjack
CECS 174 Spring 2014  
This is the repository for my CECS 174 final project. The goal of this project was to create a Blackjack game that could be played directly from the console. 

## Project Description  
This is an object-oriented blackjack game created using Java, where the players, card, and card deck are all represented as objects with specific attributes. The program can be run directly from the terminal or through an IDE such as Eclipse.  

## Getting Started
*Run the program directly from command line*  
Make sure that you have the latest [Java JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) installed. 
```
git clone https://github.com/felixthe8/Console-Blackjack.git  
```
An alternative to the above step is to simply download the repository and extract from the .zip file
```
cd BlackJack-Java  
```
```
javac Driver.java Deck.java Player.java Card.java   
```
```
java Driver 
```
*Run through Eclipse* Â 
Install [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/). Import the .java files and execute.
